  <h1>RGB Shift Glitch Filter</h1>
  <main></main>
  <p>My artistic intent was to add a glitch effect to an image by doing a color shift on the entire image.
  I am quite happy with the results. A cool quirk I noticed while testing is if you spam the button, it will loop back
  and make the image normal again, giving it a scrolling animation effect as well. 
  Or you can offset the image to give it a double vision type look. I would say
  the results are about as I expected, with the exception of those cases.
  </p>
  <p>The three sliders are the Red, Green, and Blue offset from left to right.They range from -20 to 20.
